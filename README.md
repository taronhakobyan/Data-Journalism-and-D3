# Data Journalism and D3
  Background:
   *Welcome to the newsroom! You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, 
   as well as creating charts, graphs and interactives to help readers understand the findings.

   *The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. 
     I pull the CSV files from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
     Then made a scatter plot to show the correlation.
